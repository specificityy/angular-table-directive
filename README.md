# Angular Table Directive

This is a sample AngularJS project with a simple table directive that provides sorting, filtering, paging and exposes the clicked row to the parent scope.

In order to run it you need to have <a href='http://nodejs.org/download/'>NPM</a> installed.

Then download the source code.

* Open a command window and navigate to the project's directory.

* In case you don't have <a href='http://gruntjs.com/'>Grunt</a> installed, run this command first ```npm install -g grunt-cli```

* Then enter ```npm install``` to install the project dependencies.

* And enter this command ```grunt``` to start the server. 

That should open the app in your default browser.
